Carp-Capture Version 0.02

Carp-Capture provides an object interface for capturing snapshots of Perl's
stack.  The object efficiently stores large quantities of Snapshots,
which can be retrieved as confess-like stacktraces.

Capture and later retrieval of stacktraces proved to be quite valuable
for an application that accepted specifications from users.  There were
a class of errors that could not be detected at specification time, but
only became apparent as the effects of the specifications were combined.
Being able to tag a specification with its origin in user code, enabled
pinpoint debugging assistance.
